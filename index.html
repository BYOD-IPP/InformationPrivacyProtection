<h3 id="What is BYOD">What is BYOD</h3>
<p>The practice of allowing employees, contractors and other people working in an organisation to use their own laptop computers, mobile devices and portable storage in the workplace  is known as ‘Bring Your Own Device’ or BYOD. It is a practice which can have both positive and negative implications for both the organisation and the employee – whether the device is brought into the workplace or used remotely. However much you trust the people who work for or with you, personal devices pose one of the highest risks to any organisation’s information security.</p>
<h3>Benefits of BYOD</h3>
<p>When you allow employees to bring their own devices to work, it can create a more open, efficient and relaxed environment that benefits both parties. Some BYOD benefits, include:

    Save money by eliminating the need to buy each employee specific devices and equipment.
    Increase happiness and satisfaction of your employees.
    Boost productivity by allowing employees to use devices they are familiar and comfortable with.
    Have up-to-date technology when employees get the latest and greatest devices.</p>

<h3 id="The Risks">BYOD Risks</h3>
<ul><li>Theft of company information by an employee.</li>
<li>Loss or theft of company information if the device is lost or stolen.</li>
<li>Malicious or inadvertent introduction of malware on to company systems.</li>
<li>Loss of compliance with your industry regulations or standards.</li>
<li>Loss of compliance with your industry regulations or standards.</li>
<li>Data limits being exceeded through employees downloading large files (such as movies) via the company network.</li>
<li>Employee timewasting through visiting websites / using applications on personal devices.</li>

<h3>BYOD and Information Privacy</h3>
<p>Kensington infographics (2020) published a report titled "Marrying Information Privacy with BYOD," in which they 
    found that only 7% of the 70 million devices that are stolen each year are ever found, and that 15% of 
    employees surveyed in the same study admitted to using non-work-approved devices for accessing critical 
    company information.
    The research went on to show that 54% of the companies surveyed had no system in place to remotely delete 
    employee-owned devices, and that 65% of those same companies could not even remotely delete devices if 
    they wanted to. What's more, a whopping 76% of businesses did not even bother to secure mobile devices.
    These numbers illustrate how closely BYOD and information security are linked.

    <p>Protecting personal information is crucial. Lack of access controls on personal information puts individuals at 
        risk of fraud, phishing scams, identity theft, cyber bullying, and cyber stalking.
        IBM estimates that the total cost of a Ransomware attack is $4.62 million, which is slightly higher than the 
        average cost of an information  breach ($4.24 million). In the United States, information breaches have affected 45 percent 
        of businesses. The United States incurred the highest costs worldwide due to information breaches in 2021, with an 
        average total cost of $9.05 million. Companies with more remote workers had a 60% higher average cost of 
        a information breach than companies without remote workers. Sixty-two percent of breaches that did not involve an 
        error, misuse, or physical action involved the use of stolen devices, credentials, brute force, or phishing.
        Incorrect actions by humans account for 23% of all security incidents. An average of 287 days were required 
        to detect an information breach, and an additional 80 days were required to contain it. The same IBM report found 
        that ransomware accounted for nearly 25% of malware-related cases, with an average of 4,800 infected 
        websites per month.</p>
    <h3>BYOD and Information  Privacy Measures</h3>
    <p>A MXOtech (2018) article on enforcing a secure BYOD policy, the next steps can be taken to protect sensitive    
        information on personal devices:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Use Mobile Device Management (MDM) Software</li>
       <li>Establish Security Policies for All Devices</li>
        <li>Communicate BYOD Policies to All Parties</li>
        <li>Define Acceptable Use Guidelines</li>
        <li>Set Up an Employee Exit Plan</li>
        <li>Enforce use of strong passwords</li>
        <li>Educate employees on BYOD and risks</li>
        <li>Implement real-time device monitoring</li>
    </ol>

<h3>BYOD and Public Libraries</h3>
<p>It is important to note that the researcher chose this area of study because she is currently employed 
by the National Library of South Africa in the IT department and has a strong interest in the topic of BYOD 
information privacy protection, as discussed briefly above.</p>

<p>Based on my extensive background working with library systems in Gauteng, I can say that both library 
    employees and users are frequently permitted to use their own devices while connected to the library's wired 
    and wireless network.
    Since the library's computers might not always be able to accommodate everyone, users are welcome to bring 
    their own devices. Public users can only connect to the public Wi-Fi, while library staff can use either the 
    public or the production (private) network. When connected to the production Wi-Fi, both onsite and off, 
    workers can use it to get to their work applications from anywhere.
    It is important to note that both library users and staff are permitted to bring in their own mobile devices, USB 
    storage devices, flash memory cards, CD/DVD ROMs, and other similar portable media to the library (e.g. 
    cellular smartphones, tablet computers).
    Since both library employees and users may be able to access and steal library intellectual property, sensitive 
    information, or even licensed software through the library management system, it is possible that this room, which 
    provides access to the company network and hardware, needs to be addressed.
